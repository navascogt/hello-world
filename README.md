Hello World Repository for NavasCo

Hi All!

I already use GitHub as a consumer of other sources, this is my first GitHub repository in order to upload all my works and
passion, I start using Assembler Language in a 370 mainframes,  I use rexx (interpreter in VM OS), I made my documents in 
General Markup Language (GML) the antecessor of HTML and so on, used Cobol, Fortran, then used some distributed OS like 
SCO Unix (Bought an student version and still have it in its original package), I love "vi" editor as enhanced editor from 
sed editor, wrote some shell scripts, I develop some DBase, FoxBase and Informix Applications, as 4GL I begun programming in 
CINCOM SYSTEMS MANTIS and SUPRA RDBMS, firstly in mainframe later in Unix boxes. At this moment Client/Server was the trend, 
I learned Object Oriented Programming with SmallTalk and Synchronicity Object Oriented Database, I developed a lot of
Powersoft PowerBuilder applications (Then Powersoft was bought by Sybase then by SAP, and for the time I am
writing this the rights was given to Appeon) using MS SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise and Sybase SQL 
Anywhere. The advent of distributed application comes, I develop distributed application using Sybase Jaguar later named
Sybase Enterprise Application Server (EAServer) the era of Application Servers begun. Write my first web application using MS 
Internet Information Server (IIS) and as server pages used Sybase PowerDynamo, I extensively used JavaScript, I used CGI, 
then PHP, MySQL. I really trust in the new language Java, bought my first java book and passing the years but without having 
in mind Java I was working in very interesting projects, like ITIL with products from BMC Software, Remedy, Marimba 
(Configuration Manager then BladeLogic), Control-M, PATROL (Performance Manager then ProActiveNet then TrueSight), but now I 
am backing to my roots and I start refreshing in Java, start using Python and I expected to use NodeJS too. All of this in
a Raspberry, that incredible and interested UK project, a potented mini computer that help me to consolidate my passion for 
develop and my hobbies!!! I start using Raspberry to follow airplanes (one of my passion), bought antennas and start seeing 
what is on the air near me, exploting another features like Internet of Thing - IOT, I have several sensors (temperature, 
humidity, rain, etc.) and trought Python I play with all of these.  Eventhought I used the Raspberry to follow and see the 
Formula 1 (another passion) through KOBI and LibreElec OS, I start using a camera to detect intruders for security, and in the
near future I want to integrate my other passion in some way... Rock Music and Play a drums (battery)... 

This introduction was for the GitHub Tutorial but I extend a little bit... and thing there is several not mentioned.

From now I will begin to upload my projects...
